# MUSIC-PLAYER-GUI-USING-PYTHON-
This is a Music Player GUI made with help of two main GUI libraries Pygame and Tkinter .
Pygame is a library used used to create video games .
Here I have used Pygame sound component for the music player.
Tkinter is a library for creating GUI applications.
Here I have not used much functions of it, I just used the askdirectory() method of Tkinter and some other which u will see in the code.
I have created functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. 
To create these commands, i have build some functions and i have used Tkinter to create the button in the interface.
